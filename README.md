I have creted this script to help myself log my daily activities. Some might say that we can do in calendar, but then it's your choice.

Keeping all the logs in files help me to customize the contents on my own way. Plus, I can easily combine the text and do some data analysis like finding the sentiment scores. This helps me to know my mode for a month or year and help plan by objectives. All cutomized. 

Auto generates .txt files with name as the date.
During creation it contains basic necessary text to help user wrote memo.
